# A poorly conceived Spotify API experiment
Code/assets for an old Python project I did to make a miniature Spotify player. Basically, I glued a Raspberry Pi to my handlebars so I could change the music. Y'know... Cause I couldn't already do that on my earbuds. Unfortunately Gorilla Glue lied to me and the final product did not withstand the potholes present on my commute. By the way... Probably *don't* listen to music while biking.

## Process
I used a Raspberry Pi Model 3 B+, a random 3.5in GPIO screen and a 2.1A battery, but I'm sure you could recreate it with other stuff. Just make sure to set internet and screen settings, [create a Spotify app](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) and set environment variables, download dependencies (shown in [bikeComputer.py](https://github.com/Borris-the-real-OG/portaSpoti-fy/blob/main/bikeComputer.py)), and add a shell script to run the program on startup.
